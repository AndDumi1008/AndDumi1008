- I am a Computer Science graduate from West University of Timisoara, having completed my degree in 2023. With the rapidly evolving field of IT and the increasing demand for programmers, I am excited about the numerous opportunities available across various industries. My primary interests lie in backend and frontend software development, and I have recently developed a keen interest in cloud services.

- During my work experience, I gained hands-on experience with two major cloud providers, AWS and Microsoft Azure. I successfully deployed applications using a range of services offered by these platforms, while also developing scripts for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) processes. This exposure allowed me to understand the power and potential of cloud technologies.

- In terms of web development, I am primarily focused on utilizing Spring Boot and Angular frameworks. By leveraging these technologies, I have been able to create dynamic and efficient web applications. I believe that staying updated with the latest versions and advancements of these frameworks is essential.

- The ever-expanding knowledge landscape of the software development field serves as my motivation to pursue a career in this dynamic industry. I am constantly in search of new challenges that push me to expand my skill set and broaden my understanding of emerging technologies

- Looking ahead, my aspirations involve expanding my professional network and connecting with individuals who share the same passion for software development as I do. I believe that collaborating with diverse talents will enable me to learn and grow further. By embracing new challenges, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of the field while continuously acquiring new knowledge.
